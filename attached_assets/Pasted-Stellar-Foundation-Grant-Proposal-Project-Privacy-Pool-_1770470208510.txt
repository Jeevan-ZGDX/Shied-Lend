Stellar Foundation Grant Proposal

Project: Privacy Pool — Privacy-Native Lending on Stellar
Category: Protocol Innovation / ZK-DeFi
Network: Stellar (Protocol 25)

1. Executive Summary

Privacy Pool is a privacy-native lending protocol built directly on Stellar using Protocol 25’s native zero-knowledge primitives. The protocol enables users to borrow assets by proving sufficient collateral without revealing wallet balances, exact collateral amounts, or identity on-chain.

Current DeFi lending on Stellar exposes all collateral and loan positions publicly, which is incompatible with institutional requirements. Privacy Pool addresses this gap by introducing shielded collateral commitments and zero-knowledge solvency proofs, while preserving on-chain enforceability, liquidation, and protocol solvency.

This project positions Stellar as one of the first networks with natively verifiable, privacy-preserving DeFi primitives, strengthening its competitiveness for institutional adoption.

2. Problem Statement

Most Stellar-based DeFi protocols are fully transparent. Lending platforms publicly expose:

Collateral balances

Loan positions

Wallet-level financial activity

While transparency benefits retail composability, it actively deters institutions, funds, and market makers who require confidentiality around leverage, capital allocation, and balance sheets.

Privacy Pool solves this by enabling:

Confidential collateralization

Public solvency guarantees

On-chain liquidation enforcement
—all without introducing trusted intermediaries or off-chain dependencies.

3. Proposed Solution
Core Concept: Shielded Lending

Users interact with a lending pool by:

Depositing collateral and committing it as a Poseidon hash

Generating a zero-knowledge proof that:

Collateral value ≥ required collateral ratio

Collateral is locked and unspent

Borrowing assets only after on-chain proof verification

The protocol enforces solvency and liquidation without ever revealing balances or identities.

4. Technical Design Overview
Cryptographic Foundations

Elliptic Curve: BN254

Hash Function: Poseidon

Proof System: Groth16-compatible SNARKs

Verification: On-chain via Stellar Protocol 25

On-Chain Components

Privacy Pool contract (collateral commitments, loans)

ZK verifier contract

Liquidation enforcement logic

Price oracle integration (public, identity-agnostic)

Privacy Guarantees

No plaintext collateral amounts on-chain

No linkable wallet balance disclosure

No off-chain relayers, indexers, or proof services

5. Why This Matters for Stellar

Privacy Pool:

Introduces first-class privacy primitives for DeFi on Stellar

Leverages Protocol 25 ZK features, validating their real-world utility

Creates a strong institutional on-ramp without sacrificing decentralization

Differentiates Stellar from EVM-based DeFi ecosystems

This project aligns directly with Stellar’s goals of enabling real-world financial use cases at scale.
